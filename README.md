# Real-Time Stroke Recovery Prediction Using MRI Imaging  
**LabVIEWâ€“Python Integrated Approach**

This project integrates a LabVIEW front-end and image preprocessing with Python-based machine learning to predict stroke recovery outcomes from MRI scans in real-time. 
It was developed as a research-driven academic project using the State Machine framework in LabVIEW and Python for data processing and classification.
